      <li>2 cups basmati rice, soaked for 30 minutes</li>
      <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fried onions</li>
      <li>1/4 cup ghee or oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red chili powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon garam masala powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>Fresh coriander leaves, chopped</li>
      <li>Fresh mint leaves, chopped</li>
      <li>A few saffron strands (soaked in warm milk)</li>
      <li>Whole spices (2-3 cloves, 1 cinnamon stick, 2 green cardamoms)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix mutton with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, coriander powder, salt, fried onions, and half of the fresh coriander and mint leaves. Marinate for at least 1-2 hours (preferably overnight for best results).</li>
      <li>In a large pot, boil water with whole spices and a pinch of salt. Add soaked rice and cook until it is 70% done. Drain the rice and set aside.</li>
      <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot, spread the marinated mutton evenly at the bottom.</li>
      <li>Layer the partially cooked rice on top of the marinated mutton. Sprinkle the remaining coriander and mint leaves, saffron milk, and ghee on top.</li>
      <li>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, sealing it with dough if possible, to trap the steam.</li>
      <li>Place the pot on low heat and cook for 45-60 minutes, until the mutton is tender and the rice is fully cooked.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and let it rest for a few minutes before opening the lid. Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving.</li>
      <li>Serve hot with raita or a side of your choice.</li>
    </ol>
