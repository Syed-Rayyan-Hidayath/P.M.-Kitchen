    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>500g dried apricots (khubani)</li>
      <li>2 cups sugar</li>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
      <li>Almonds for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Rinse the dried apricots thoroughly and soak them in water overnight or for at least 6-8 hours.</li>
      <li>After soaking, remove the apricots from the water (reserving the water) and de-seed them. Crack open the seeds to remove the kernels if you wish to add them to the murabba.</li>
      <li>In a large pot, add the soaked apricots, reserved water, and sugar. Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
      <li>Add cardamom powder and continue to cook until the syrup thickens slightly and the apricots become soft and glazed, about 20-30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in lemon juice and cook for another 5 minutes to enhance the flavor and preserve the murabba.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat and let it cool completely. Garnish with almond slivers or the apricot kernels if desired.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a sterilized jar and store in the refrigerator. Khubani ka Murabba can be enjoyed as a dessert or spread on toast.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Extras</h2>
    <p>Khubani ka Murabba is a sweet preserve popular in Hyderabadi cuisine. You can adjust the sweetness by adding more or less sugar, depending on your preference.</p>
