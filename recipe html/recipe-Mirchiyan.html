      <li>1/2 cup gram flour (besan)</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon red chili powder</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Wash and pat dry the green chilies. Make a small slit along the side of each chili, being careful not to cut all the way through.</li>
      <li>In a mixing bowl, add gram flour, turmeric powder, red chili powder, cumin seeds, salt, asafoetida, and 1 tablespoon of oil. Mix well.</li>
      <li>Gradually add water to the mixture, stirring until you achieve a thick, smooth batter.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Dip each chili into the batter, coating it well. Carefully drop it into the hot oil.</li>
      <li>Fry the chilies until golden and crispy, turning occasionally for even cooking.</li>
      <li>Remove and drain on paper towels. Serve hot with tamarind chutney or mint chutney.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Extras</h2>
    <p>Mirchiyan is a popular street snack, often enjoyed during monsoon season. You can stuff the chilies with spiced mashed potatoes or paneer for a more filling version.</p>
